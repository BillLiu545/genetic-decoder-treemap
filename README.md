# genetic-decoder-treemap
In this repository is a Java-based genetic decoder using the built in TreeMap data structure. There are functions to add or remove chemical bases to the gene, and mutate the existing gene at a certain position or at random.

# How does it work?
Given an empty gene outputted as a string, it is printed out as "N/A". When clicking the buttons to add/remove new chemical base, the string is updated with the new chemical bases. In the file menu, we have options to mutate a certain chemical base at a specific entry number (through user input), mutate an existing base at a random position with the new base randomly selected, and mutating all the bases in order by a randomly selevted base for each.
